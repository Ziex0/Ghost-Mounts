# Ghost-Mounts
Core modification for TrinityCore, Tested on 3.3.5 branch.

# About
These are Core Modification Scripts that allows players to mount when they're dead.

I made two different patches:

1st patch - ghost_ground_mount which mounts you with a Swift Spectral Tiger when you're dead (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=24004/swift-spectral-tiger)

2nd patch - ghost_flying_mount which mounts you with a Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=29582/win...the-ebon-blade)

Note that upon resurrection you'll be back to normal speed, dismounted and flying state disabled.

# How to install
1. Go to your source root folder and place ghost_ground_mount.patch
2. Right-Click on an empty space in your source directory and Select Git Bash here
3. Type the following command: git apply ghost_ground_mount.patch
4. Use CMake (Configure and Generate) then re-compile.
